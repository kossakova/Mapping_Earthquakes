## *Resources*
- USGS website 
- GeoJSON URL
- JavaScript
- D3 Library
- Leaflet Library
- Mapbox API


## Purpose
In this project we sifted through data provided by U.S. Geological Survey to create a visualization to map earthquake data by latitude and longitude. The purpose of this project is to visually show the differences between the magnitudes of earthquakes all over the world for the last seven days.

## Tasks

To complete this project, we used a URL for GeoJSON earthquake data from the USGS website and retrieved geographical coordinates and the magnitudes of earthquakes and then add the data to a map. Our approach was to use the JavaScript and the D3.js library to retrieve the coordinates and magnitudes of the earthquakes from the GeoJSON data. We also used the Leaflet library to plot the data on a Mapbox map through an API request and created interactivity for the earthquake data.

## Approach
We created sophisticated plots by using all the data provided and to plot three different layers to our map: Streets, Dark and Satellite. After that, using D3 we added interactive buttons that filers our three different set of data approaching map by our preferences. There are three different filters that e applied to pour map: earthquakes, tectonic plates and major earthquakes, all filers can be used simultaneously with any layer of your choice.
